# Extract Slido Questions
The idea is retrieve questions in a Slido session and save in a txt file

To use the WPF application, you will need to save the page with the questions
- Access the desired Sli.do;
- Save the HTML Page (a simple CTRL + S);
- Open the WPF program, hit the Upload button;
- Choose the saved HTML file;
- Hit the Get "Question Button";
- Choose the directory and name file to save the content.
